<h1> Ultrasound Contrast Bubble Simulation</h1>
<h3><span style="font-style: italic;">Bubblesim</span> Overview</h3>
<ul>
  <li><em><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></em>Simulator for
estimating the radial oscillation and scattered sound from an
ultrasound contrast bubble. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Implemented as a toolbox in MATLAB. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Updated and tested in Matlab ver. 7.0, originally written for
Matlab 5.2<br>
  </li>
  <li>Developed
as a part of my doctoral studies at NTNU, The Norwegian University of
Science
and Technology.</li>
  <li>Main application is to simulate contrast agents for medical
ultrasound imaging</li>
  <li>Designed for micrometer-sized bubbles exposed to
Megahertz-frequency ultrasound. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Only the radial oscillation mode is included, i.e. the
oscillation is spherically symmetric. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Nonlinear terms are fully included, the response is calculated by
simulating an ODE in the time domain. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Shell is included by a viscoelastic material model. Thickness and
viscoelastic parameters of the shell must be specified by the user.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>Please be aware that this program is very experimental, and the
documentation is not as extensive as it should be. <br>
</p>
<h3>Example of use<br>
</h3>
<p>An example of program
operation is shown below. The left image is the graphical user
interface
used to specify bubble, pulse and calculation parameters. The right
image
shows the results of the simulation, containing the driving ultrasound
pulse,
the bubble radius and scattered sound pulse in the time domain, and the
power
spectra of the driving pulse and of the scattered sound. Click on one
of
the images to get a full-size view.</p>
